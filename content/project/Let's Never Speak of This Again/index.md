title: Let's Never Speak of this Again
summary: A short film I worked on as the sound designer in December of 2019 (with one day of day-playing sound recordist). The “sound mixer” credit here also encompasses dialogue editing and sound mixing. I don’t know much about college parties, but a friend told me that this really captured the awkwardness of them.
