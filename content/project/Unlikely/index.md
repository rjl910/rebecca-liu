title: Unlikely
summary: A web series I worked on as sound designer and sound recordist/boom operator from February to June of 2020. The “sound designer” credit here also encompasses dialogue editing and sound mixing. I really find the overall concept just so funny; there’s another series we could make of just Rayna’s college life.
