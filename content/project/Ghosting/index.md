title: Ghosting
summary: Final project for Grady College’s EMST 3210 class, made during March – April 2018. Credited here as lead sound designer, sound mixer, and boom operator. The “lead sound designer” credit here also encompasses dialogue editing, sound mixing, and some light Foley work. It’s probably a good thing this TV model’s not that common anymore.
