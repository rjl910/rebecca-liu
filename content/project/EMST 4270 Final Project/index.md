title: EMST 4270 Final Project
summary: Final project for an audio production class, April 2019. The professor gave us this excerpt from Edith Piaf and Theo Sarapo’s song A quoi ça sert l’amour. All sound here was recorded and mixed by me, India Persaud, and Dom Ferrell. I enjoy the original song a lot, so I hope this little project is just as fun.
