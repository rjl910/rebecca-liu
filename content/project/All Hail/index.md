title: All Hail
summary: A short film I worked on as the sound designer, during December of 2019. The “sound designer” credit here also encompasses dialogue editing, sound mixing, and some light Foley work. I think I had a boring high school life, because I cannot imagine anyone I knew having a party like the one Frances went to.
