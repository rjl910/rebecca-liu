title: City of Statues
summary: Content Warnings- Life threatening situations, loud noises and screams, an infectious illness, gun and gunshots, harsh language, discussion of death, and on screen character death. A work done for 11th Hour Audio’s 2022 challenge. I did the action sound design. I really enjoyed shaping the statues’ footsteps, though to be honest I am not sure if they sound all that scary.
